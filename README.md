This project introduces us to the concept of clustering and teaches how to use ```Kubernetes``` and ```Docker``` technologies together.
We will use ```Kubernetes``` for implementing an infrastructure with different services, therefore, we will install a cluster that groups several service containers. Each service works in a dedicated container, and the containers have the same name as the associated service. For performance reasons the containers are built on ```Alpine Linux```.

### How to use it

Run the script :

```
./setup.sh
```
